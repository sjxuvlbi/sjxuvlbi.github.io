I am a PostDoc researcher at Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute ([KASI](https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index)). 

#I study supermassive black holes and relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN), particularly in the nearby giant radio galaxy M87. I use very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) techniques to study how the jets are launched, collimated, and accelerated to relativistic speeds. I am also interested in calibration and imaging of VLBI data. I have developed a novel calibration pipeline [GPCAL](https://jhparkastro.github.io/software/) for removing artificially generated signals in VLBI data. Based on this expertise, I have made a significant contribution to the [first polarized image around a black hole](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910L..12E/abstract) released by the EHT collaboration in March 2021. My current research interests are focused on (i) [developing calibration tools for VLBI data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...85P/abstract), (ii) [revealing the magnetic field structure in AGN jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...871..257P/abstract), and (iii) [understanding the collimation and acceleration processes in AGN jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...76P/abstract).

#I was born in Seoul, Republic of Korea. I received a B.S. in Astronomy from Seoul National University (SNU) in 2013. I continued to study and earned a Ph.D. in Astronomy from SNU in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Sascha Trippe](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~trippe/). I worked at [ASIAA](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2019, and as a EACOA fellow in 2020-2022. I worked for the Greenland Telescope ([GLT](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/project/vlbi.php)) project together with Dr. [Keiichi Asada](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=asada) and Dr. [Masanori Nakamura](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=jpark). I started working at [KASI](https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index) since 2022. My current main research interest is studying AGN jets and supermassive black holes using global millimeter VLBI arrays such as the EHT and [GMVA](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/vlbi/globalmm/).

#I share some photos taken at the EHT M87 polarization press conference held at ASIAA in Taiwan, where I was the main speaker. As a scientist, it was an exciting moment surrounded by many media people. More news related to the conference can be found [here](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/news/shownews.php?i=c224900c36836fdf6ef50d6963df9c46).
